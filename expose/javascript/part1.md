### If the question has you write any code, unless specified otherwise, create a JavaScript file with the name format partX-questionY.js. So for example, if the question was number 14 in part 1 you would have part1-question14.js as your filename. You can run and test these js files with Node from your command line by executing the command “node filename.js”.
